## About the Project:

* Find your ideal accommodation for your next trip...

- Users can sign up and have their own user profile page on the website.

- After they have sign up for the website, they can create rooms at 'Holiday Rentals' and add photos/details for their rooms.

- Once the room is published and ready for rent, other users can search for the room and make reservations. (It's a mock up school project of holiday rentals websites.)
