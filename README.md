## About the Project:

- Find your ideal accommodation for your next trip:

- Users can create rooms at 'Holiday Rentals' within their accounts, and they can add photos, listing details, price(per/night), description, amenities & location for their rooms.

- Once the room is ready for rent, other users can search for the room and make reservations. (It's a mock up school project of holiday rentals websites.)
