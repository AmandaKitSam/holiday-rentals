* Find your ideal accommodation for your next trip...

- Users can sign up and have their own user profile page on the website. User's photo is connect with Gravatar. If the user has uploaded photo with Gravatar, then the photo will appear at the nav bar next to user's name and email. (otherwise, it will appear as numbers)

- After they have sign up for the website, they can create rooms at 'Holiday Rentals' and add photos/details for their rooms.

- Once the room is ready for rent and published, other users can search for the room and make reservations. (It's a mock up school project of holiday rentals websites.)
